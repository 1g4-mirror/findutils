* There are many bugs to be fixed and features to be added to findutils.
The current distribution is a snapshot which fixes many
problems, but leaves others unsolved.  Many of the known problems are
not listed below.  Over the next few releases, I hope to fix more
items, and add the unfixed problems below.

* Internationalization
** Is ansi2knr internationalized?  Does it need to be?

** Should these files be internationalized?
	strftime.c

** Should translated long options be offered in locate and xargs?
** updatedb.sh should be internationalized as well

* new standards with Austin group
** "-H" and "-L" options to find were added by Austin group standards.
They need to be implemented.

**Austin added the following options to xargs:
-I perhaps replaces -i

-L perhaps replaces -l

-E slightly different from -e


* Add case insensitive locate option.  Patch is available.

* Should fnmatch.h be a link to fnmatch.hin?
See tar distribution for an example. 

* Eliminate unnecessary strcpy calls in xargs.

* lib/getline.c
getline.c contains a function getstr which is needed in locate,
but is not in the standard library.  In fact getstr is in curses.
This problem needs to be fixed.  Can getstr be removed?  Can getline.c
be optionally included, or is it mandatory?

* man pages for frcode, bigram, and code
Perhaps a better description in texi pages as well.

* large file problems
depcomp gets added by automake
strncasecmp is needed
which requires strcasecmp
getline.c temporarily removed from Makefile.am
remove getline.o from LIBOBJS
remove extra AM_FUNC_GETLINE

There are many bugs to be fixed and features to be added to
findutils.  The current distribution is a snapshot which fixes many
problems, but leaves others unsolved.  Many of the known problems are
not listed below.  Over the next few releases, I hope to fix more
items, and add the unfixed problems below.

Is ansi2knr internationalized?  Does it need to be?
Should these files be internationalized?
	strftime.c
Should translated long options be offered in locate and xargs?
updatedb.sh should be internationalized as well

Add case insensitive locate option.  Patch is available.

Should fnmatch.h be a link to fnmatch.hin.  See tar distribution for
an example. 

Eliminate unnecessary strcpy calls in xargs.

lib/getline.c contains a function getstr which is needed in locate,
but is not in the standard library.  In fact getstr is in curses.
This problem needs to be fixed.  Can getstr be removed?  Can getline.c
be optionally included?

Files which were modified in findutils/lib:
changed in findutils:
getline.c (skipped for now)
nextelem.c (twice)

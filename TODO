There are many bugs to be fixed and features to be added to
findutils.  The current distribution is a snapshot which fixes many
problems, but leaves others unsolved.  Many of the known problems are
not listed below.  Over the next few releases, I hope to fix more
items, and add the unfixed problems below.

internationalization

case insensitive locate option

Eliminate unnecessary strcpy calls in xargs.

Need to transfer appropriate parts of m4 directory

Files which were modified in findutils/lib
changed in findutils:
getline.c (skipped for now)
nextelem.c (twice)


alloca.c
dirname.c
error.c
fileblocks.c
filemode.c
fnmatch.c
fnmatch.h
getline.c
getopt.c
getopt.h
getopt1.c
idcache.c
memcmp.c

regex.c
regex.h
savedir.c
stpcpy.c
strdup.c
strftime.c
strstr.c
strtol.c

compare new getline.c with modified Debian getline.c
can getstr in locate.c be replaced with something more standard?

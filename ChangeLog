2014-08-24  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Stop using the obsolete modules strtol and strtoul.
	* import-gnulib.config (modules): remove strtol and strtoul.

2014-08-23  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Revert the previous ChangeLog split and split at 2013 instead.
	* ChangeLog-2013: Split the ChangeLog at 2013 rather than 2008;
	hence, delete ChangeLog-2008.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute ChangeLog-2013.
	* .gitattributes: Use the ChangeLog merge driver for ChangeLog-2013.

	Remove obsolete TODO entries.
	* TODO: remove BeOS multibyte entry (we fixed this by using the
	gnulib wcwidth module; see https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?19979).
	Remove comment about problems with gcc-2.95.2 on
	sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3_U1; we'll look at the problem if anyone ever
	complains that something doesn't work (though gnulib may in fact
	no longer work on such an old platform in any case).
	Remove some TODOs around locate performance; nobody's reported
	performance issues, and we can examine any specific issues when
	the arise.
	Remove TODO about the largeness of depcomp; at 22KiB, it's much
	smaller than this ChangeLog file, for example.

	Remove obsolete TOLOWER/TOUPPER macros.
	* locate/locate.c: The TOLOWER and TOUPPER macros are no longer
	used.   Do not define them.
	* TODO: Remove obsolete entry for TOLOWER/TOUPPER.

	Don't overflow sig_atomic_t for --max-procs.
	* xargs/xargs.c (__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS): Define __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS
	in order to ensure that <stdint.h> defines the SIG_ATOMIC_MAX
	macro, which we need.
	(MAX_PROC_MAX): Define this as the maximum allowed value of
	proc_max.
	(main): Show the value of MAX_PROC_MAX for --show-limits.
	(increment_proc_max): Don't increment proc_max beyond
	MAX_PROC_MAX.
	(parse_num): Fix small error in the error message; if the limit on
	the value of a command-line argument is N, explain that the user
	should specify a value <= N, not < N.
	* xargs/xargs.1: Document the upper limit on --max-procs.
	* doc/find.texi (Controlling Parallelism): Document the upper
	limit on the amount of parallelism.
	(xargs options): Document the limit on the value you can specify
	for --max-procs.

	Prepare for later generating the ChangeLog file from the git log.
	* ChangeLog-2008: Split this file out from the main ChangeLog file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute ChangeLog-2008.
	* .gitattributes: Use the changelog merge driver for
	ChangeLog-2008.

2014-08-21  Sami Kerola  <kerolasa@iki.fi> (tiny change)

	When reporting failure to change/save directory, mention its name.
	* find/exec.c (prep_child_for_exec): When issuing an error message
	about a failure to change directory, mention the directory.

	initial working directory.
	(cleanup_initial_cwd): Also when restoring the initial working
	directory.

2014-08-19  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Fix bug #42903: the print statement doesn't exist in Python 3.
	* find/testsuite/checklists.py (main): Avoid using the print
	statement as it is not compatible with Python 3.  We use
	sys.stdout.write, since our needs here are simple.

2014-08-19  Bernhard Voelker <mail@bernhard-voelker.de>

	doc: remove repeated paragraph in locate's texinfo manual
	* doc/find.texi (Invoking locate): Remove repeated sentence,
	introduced by commit FINDUTILS_4_2_23-1-28-g1e08148 in 2005.
	Reported by Dan Jacobsen <jidanni@jidanni.org> in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-findutils/2014-08/msg00003.html
	This patch was edited by James Youngman to include a ChangeLog
	update, hence the changed date.

2014-08-19  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Likewise, and add today's date.
	* po/*: Update with 'make dist'.

	Standardize on "initialize".
	* find/exec.c (initialise_wd_for_exec): rename to
	initialize_wd_for_exec, since "initialize" is the preferred form
	even in UK spelling (the OED says "initialise" is a variant).
	Update callers (it's a static function).  Update spelling in
	comments.
	* find/find.c (main): Fix missing "to" in error message and update
	"initialise" to "initialize".  Update comment too.
	* find/ftsfind.c (main): Update spelling in error message.
	* lib/listfile.c (print_name_with_quoting): spelling change in
	comment.

	* find/print.c (format_date): Likewise.
	* doc/find-maint.texi (Tools): Update spelling.

	Bug #42793: mention the bugfix in NEWS.
	* NEWS: mention the bugfix.

	Fix bug #42793: "Failed to write output" with -ls.
	* lib/listfile.c (print_name_with_quoting): Avoid using the
	variable fprintf_result before it is initialised.  I hope this
	fixes Savannah bug #42793.

	Update the version number following the recent release.
	* configure.ac: Move on from 4.5.13.
	* NEWS: Move on from 4.5.13.

	Prepare for release of 4.5.13.
	* configure.ac: Change the version number to 4.5.13.
	* NEWS: Mention some documentation bug fixes which have been
	applied (ChangeLog entries already exist for these).  Change the
	version number of the top section of the NEWS file.

2014-05-31  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Enable parallel tests.
	* find/testsuite/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Enable
	parallel-tests.  This will only include tests known directly via
	$(TESTS), not DejaGnu tests.

	Check there are no duplicate configuration entries for test files.
	* find/testsuite/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST_XO): Remove duplicate items.
	(EXTRA_DIST_EXP): Likewise.
	(checklists): Run with the other checks, using check-local.  Don't
	echo the full command, because it will make the summary of the
	Automake-driven tests scroll offscreen.
	(TEST_EXTENSIONS): Add .sh and .py.

	Routinely check .xo and .exp test file lists in a clearer way.
	* find/testsuite/checklists.py: Tiny program for checking that the
	correct lists of .xo and .exp files exist in the Makefile.am file.
	* Makefile.am (checklists): Update target to use the new program.
	Make this target phony.

	Update German translation.
	* po/de.po: Update German translation from the Translation
	Project.

	Several updates and clarifications to README-hacking.
	* README-hacking: Explain that tool-versions.txt is not checked
	into git.  The repository has grown from 14MB to 16MB.  Gnulib is
	now a submodule and the directory we keep it in has changed.
	Remove the suggestion to rsync the translations from the
	translation project, since the files that fetches seem to be out
	of date.  Move the instruction to update ChangeLog to a more
	prominent place.  Mention that there is an electronic process for
	assignments in some locations.  Update the copyright year.

2014-05-11  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* po/POTFILES.in: mark strings from gnulib for translation.

GNU findutils NEWS - User visible changes.	-*- outline -*- (allout)
* Major changes in release 4.2.1
** Bug Fixes
*** find -iname now works correctly on systems that have an fnmatch() function 
    that does not support FNM_CASEFOLD
*** updatedb now uses signal names for "trap" instead of numbers, 
    as per bug #9465 (see http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/trap.html)
*** Better support for systems lacking intmax_t
** Other Changes
**** findutils now uses a newer version of gnulib (dated 2004-10-17).

* Major changes in release 4.2.0
** Functionality Changes
*** xargs now works better when the environment variables are very extensive.
    The xargs command used to run into difficulties if the environment 
    data contained more than 2480 bytes.
*** New options -wholename and -iwholename 
    As per the GNU Projecvt coding standard, These are preferred over 
    the -path and -ipath options.  Using -ipath now generates a warning,
    though -path does not (since HPUX also offers -path).   
*** The environment variable FIND_BLOCK_SIZE is now ignored.
*** New option "-ignore_readdir_race"
    silences an error messages which would otherwise occur if a file is removed
    after find has read it from the directory using readdir(), but before 
    find stats the file.  There is also an option
    -noignore_readdir_race which has the opposite effect.   
**  Documentation improvements
*** The -size option of find is now documented in more detail
*** POSIX compliance and GNU extensions
    The find manual page also now includes a section 
    which describes the relationship between the features of GNU 
    find and the POSIX standard.  Some other small improvements 
    to the find and xargs manual pages have been made.
*** The argument to the -fprintf directive is now better documented.
    The escape code '\0' for the `-printf' predicate of find is now
    documented, and the documentation for the %k and %b specifiers
    has been improved.  
*** xargs -i is now more clearly documented.
** Bug Fixes
*** locate 'pa*d' will now find /etc/passwd (if it exists, of course)
*** xargs standard input is not inherited by child processes
    If the command invoked by xargs reads from its standard input, 
    it now gets nothing, as opposed to stealing data from the 
    list of files that xargs is trying to read.
*** Better support for 64-bit systems.
*** The command "xargs -i -n1" now works as one might expect, 
    I think this is a strange thing to want to do.  
*** Arguments to find -mtime that are too large are now diagnosed 
    Previously, this just used to cause find just to do the wrong thing.
*** updatedb is now somewhat more robust
    The updatedb shell script now does not generate an empty 
    database if it fails.  
*** Sanity-check on some data read from locatedb
    Locate now detects some types of file corruption in the 
    locate database.
*** The %k format specifier for -fprintf now works
    This was broken in 4.1.20.

* Major changes in release 4.1.20:
** New maintainer, James Youngman <jay@gnu.org>
** As far as I know, this is the first release after 4.1.7, but I've left 
   a gap just in case. 
** We now use an "imported" version of gnulib, rather than including 
   a copy of the gnulib code in our CVS repository.   There are no
   differences in the build instructions, though (unless you are 
   building directly from CVS, in which case please read the file
   README-CVS).
** There are no (deliberate) functional changes in version 4.1.20.

* Major changes in release 4.1.7:
fix problem so that default "-print" is added when "-prune" is used.
security fixes related to directories changing while find is executing.

* Major changes in release 4.1.6:
correct bug in prune.
added --ignore-case option for locate

* Major changes in release 4.1.5:
Add support for large files

* Major changes in release 4.1.4:
bug fixes, more up-to-date languages.

* Major changes in release 4.1.3:
added internationalization and localization.

* Major changes in release 4.1.1:
attempt at successful compilation on many platforms after years of neglect
 "--existing" option added to locate "--prunefs" option added to updatedb

* Major changes in release 4.1:

** Distribution renamed to findutils.
** updatedb is now a user command, installed in $exec_prefix/bin
  instead of $exec_prefix/libexec.
** A few problems in Makefiles and testsuite corrected.

* Major changes in release 4.0:

** Documentation:
*** Texinfo manual.
*** Man page for updatedb.
*** Man page for the locate database formats.

** find:
*** Takes less CPU time on long paths, because it uses chdir to descend
   trees, so it does fewer inode lookups.
*** Does not get trapped in symbolic link loops when -follow is given.
*** Supports "-fstype afs" if you have /afs and /usr/afsws/include
   and you configure using the --with-afs option.
*** New action -fls FILE; like -ls but writes to FILE.

** locate:
*** Supports a new database format, which is 8-bit clean and
   allows machines with different byte orderings and integer sizes to
   share the databases.  The new locate can also detect and read the
   old database format automatically.  The new databases are typically
   30% or more larger than the old ones (due to allowing all 8 bits in
   file names).  Search times are approximately the same, or faster on
   some systems.
*** Warns if a file name database is more than 8 days old.

** updatedb:
*** Takes command-line options.

** xargs:
*** Performance improved 10-20%.
*** The EOF string is not used when -0 is given.
*** Now has a test suite.  Some minor bugs fixed as a result.

* Major changes in release 3.8:

** case insensitive versions of -lname, -name, -path, -regex:
  -ilname, -iname, -ipath, -iregex
** %F directive for -printf, -fprintf to print file system type

* Major changes in release 3.7:

** locate can search multiple databases
** locate has an option to specify the database path
** updatedb no longer goes into an infinite loop with some versions of tail

This file describes how to build findutils starting from a set of code
checked out of CVS, rather than from a releasaed source distribution.

1. Prerequisites
 * A C compiler
 * GNU Autoconf version 2.57 or later (earlier versions *may* work)
 * GNU Automake version 1.7 or later (earlier versions *may* work)
 * CVS

2. Obtain a copy of Gnulib

 To obtain a copy of the gnulib library, check it out via anonymous CVS
 from the GNU CVS server.   Make sure you check it out into a separate 
 directory, away from the findutils sources.
 
    cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnulib login
 (when asked for a password, just press return)

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnulib co gnulib



3. Generate a gnulib installation within the fileutils source tree

 Change your working directory to the findutils source directory (that 
 is, the directory containing this file).   Then run the following 
 command:-

    sh import-gnulib.sh   <name of the directory containing gnulib>

The above command may result in some errors from autoconf and
automake.  These are benign unless they occur again in the following
step - so don;t worry about them unless you see them both times.

4. Generate the configure scripts and Makefile.in files.

    aclocal -I gnulib/m4 
    autoheader
    autoconf
    automake --add-missing --copy

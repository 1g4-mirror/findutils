This file describes how to build findutils starting from a set of code
checked out of CVS, rather than from a released source distribution.

1. Prerequisites
 * CVS (to check out findutils itself)
 * git (to check out the gnulib code)
 * A C compiler, linker and software development libraries (the standard
   C library)
 * GNU Autoconf version 2.61 or later (earlier versions *may* work)
 * GNU Automake version 1.9 or later (earlier versions *may* work)
 * GNU m4 version 1.4 or later
 * GNU gettext (unless you use configure --disable-nls)

2. Generate a gnulib installation within the fileutils source tree

 Change your working directory to the findutils source directory (that 
 is, the directory containing this file).   Then run the following 
 command:-

    sh import-gnulib.sh   

 This command will use CVS to check out the version of gnulib which is
 intended to work with the findutils source you already have, as
 configured by the file import-gnulib.config.  The gnulib code itself
 is left in the directory "gnulib-git".  The "gnulib" directory
 contains just the gnulib files that findutils needs during the build
 process.

 If you want to build findutils with a different version of gnulib,
 just edit import-gnulib.config to change the version and then re-run
 import-gnulib.sh.  When specifying the version, you can specify
 either the date or a CVS tag.  If making any kind of release, please
 use a fully identifying version (rather than just, say, "HEAD").

 The import-gnulib.sh script will also run Autoconf and Automake to
 generate the "configure" script and "Makefile.in" files.  Should you 
 need to do this manually, you can do it like this :-

    aclocal -I m4 -I gnulib/m4     && \
    autoheader			   && \
    autoconf			   && \
    automake --add-missing --copy

3. (Optional) Update the translations

    rsync -Lrtvz  translationproject.org::tp/latest/findutils/ po

3. Run "configure" and "make" in the normal way.  

 If you have GNU libintl installed, you can just run "configure".
 Otherwise, run "configure --disable-nls".
